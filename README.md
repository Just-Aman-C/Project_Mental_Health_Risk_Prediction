 Mental Health Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

  Overview

This project aims to predict whether an individual may require mental health treatment based on survey responses and demographic information using supervised machine learning techniques.
The system processes structured survey data, performs preprocessing, trains multiple classification models, and evaluates their performance using reliable metrics such as accuracy and cross-validation.


 Problem Statement

Mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are increasing globally. Early identification can help individuals seek timely support. However, manual assessment is subjective and time-consuming.
This project uses Machine Learning to build a predictive model that identifies individuals who may require mental health treatment based on survey features.



 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Seaborn (for confusion matrix visualization)


 Machine Learning Algorithms

The project compares multiple classification models:

- Logistic Regression (baseline linear model)
- Random Forest Classifier (ensemble model)

Additionally, the system uses:

- Train-Test Split
- 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearch)
- Confusion Matrix Evaluation
